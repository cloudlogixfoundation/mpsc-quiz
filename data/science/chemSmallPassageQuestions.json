    "question": "Read the passage and answer the question:\nWater has a high specific heat capacity, which means it can absorb or release large amounts of heat with little change in its own temperature. This property makes water an excellent coolant and is also why coastal regions have moderate climates.\n\nWhat is the primary reason coastal regions have moderate temperatures?",
    "options": [
      "Due to strong ocean currents",
      "Due to high evaporation rate",
      "Because water heats and cools slowly",
      "Because of low atmospheric pressure"

    "question": "Read the passage and answer the question:\nBoyle’s law states that for a fixed amount of gas kept at constant temperature, the product of pressure and volume is a constant. This means that if the pressure on a gas increases, its volume decreases proportionally.\n\nWhat happens to the volume of a gas if pressure is doubled while temperature remains constant?",
    "options": [
      "Volume doubles",
      "Volume remains constant",

Unlike water, dry ice does not melt into a liquid but directly converts into a gas, a process known as sublimation. This property is useful in refrigeration and theatrical fog effects.\n\nWhich of the following processes is demonstrated by dry ice?",

    "question": "Read the passage and answer the question:\nThe Kelvin scale is used in scientific research because it begins at absolute zero, the point where all molecular motion stops. It avoids negative temperatures, making it ideal for thermodynamic calculations.\n\nWhy is the Kelvin scale preferred in scientific studies?",
    "options": [
      "It is easier to use",
      "It includes decimals",
      "It avoids negative values and starts from absolute zero",

    "question": "Read the passage and answer the question:\nDuring a phase change such as melting or boiling, the temperature of a substance remains constant despite continuous heating. This is because the added energy is used to overcome the intermolecular forces, not to increase temperature.\n\nWhat is the heat supplied during a phase change used for?",
    "options": [
      "To increase temperature",
      "To increase pressure",
      "To break intermolecular forces",
